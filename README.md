# v-ui

`v-ui` is meant to supplement native bootstrap with more advanced versions of many components, and some new ones.


> **Note**  
> `v-ui` is just a hobby experiment right now, with no stable API or code, and no strict roadmap or project plan.
> It will take a while for me to figure out exactly what makes sense and what is required.

## What’s planned

Here are some of the ideas I have and want to implement:

#### Extended Components

- [ ] Button with loading state
- [ ] Enhanced dropdowns 
- [ ] Advanced text input (like GitHub search)
- ...more to come

#### New Components

- [ ] Combobox (text input + dropdown)
- [ ] User avatar
- [ ] Stacked avatars
- ...more to come

## How you can contribute

While I’m still in the process of finding out how all the pieces go together, you can suggest ideas using the issues.
I will accept contributions at some point, but first I need to figure out some basics regarding structure, style and which features to actually include myself.
